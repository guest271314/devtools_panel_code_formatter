# DevTools Panel Code Formatter

Formatting feature for Snippets in DevTools was recently (2023) removed from Chromium, see [Was format {} option of Snippets intentionally removed on Chromium 114.0.5715.0?](https://groups.google.com/g/google-chrome-developer-tools/c/-bvBoff3Fzg/m/KHAZK4ENAQAJ).

This is an extension that creates a dedicated DevTools panel "Formatter" for the purpose of formatting JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
